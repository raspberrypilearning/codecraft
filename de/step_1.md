## Introduction:

In this project, children will learn aspects of graphics and game design by making improvements to a basic 2D Minecraft clone. Children will create new resources, as well as crafting rules for combining resources to make new ones. This will be achieved by understanding and manipulating variables, lists and dictionaries.

## Online Resources

**This project uses Python 3.** We recommend using [trinket](https://trinket.io/) to write Python online. This project contains the following Trinkets:

+ ['CodeCraft' starting point -- jumpto.cc/codecraft-go](http://jumpto.cc/codecraft-go)

There is also a trinket containing the completed project:

+ [‘CodeCraft’ Finished -- trinket.io/python/9ac3995d69](https://trinket.io/python/9ac3995d69)

## Offline Resources

This project can be [completed offline](https://www.codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/resources/python-working-offline/) if preferred. You can access the project resources by clicking the 'Project Materials' link for this project. This link contains a 'Project Resources' section, which includes resources that children will need to complete this project offline. Make sure that each child has access to a copy of these resources. This section includes the following files:

+ codecraft/codecraft.py
+ codecraft/variables.py
+ codecraft/player.gif
+ codecraft/dirt.gif
+ codecraft/grass.gif
+ codecraft/water.gif
+ codecraft/brick.gif

You can also find a completed version of this project in the 'Volunteer Resources' section, which contains:

+ codecraft-finished/codecraft.py
+ codecraft-finished/variables.py
+ codecraft-finished/player.gif
+ codecraft-finished/dirt.gif
+ codecraft-finished/grass.gif
+ codecraft-finished/water.gif
+ codecraft-finished/brick.gif
+ codecraft-finished/wood.gif
+ codecraft-finished/plank.gif

(All of the resources above are also downloadable as project and volunteer `.zip` files.)

## Learning Objectives

+ Creating and editing graphics;
+ Game design;
+ Editing: 
    + Variables;
    + Lists;
    + Dictionaries.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Design basic 2D and 3D assets.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/design/creator)

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)

## Challenges

+ "Build your world" - Playing the game, placing and crafting existing blocks;
+ "Change your world size" - editing the `MAPWIDTH` and `MAPHEIGHT` variables to change the world size;
+ "Creating sand" - Creating a new sand resource, along with associated game data.
+ "Crafting glass from sand" - Creating a new craftable glass resource.
+ "Create more resources" - Use what's been learnt to create more blocks and crafting rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

+ **Offline Python does not work with .png images. .gif images have been supplied for offline use.**
+ Children may need reminding that elements of a dictionary/list are separated by a comma. For example, when adding inventory items, graphics and crafting rules to the game.
